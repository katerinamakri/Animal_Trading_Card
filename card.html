			<p class="description">Giant pandas are bears that are found in thick bamboo forests, high up in the mountains of central China where they are considered a national treasure. According to legend, the panda was once an all-white bear. When a small girl tried to save a panda cub from being attacked by a leopard, the leopard killed the girl instead. Pandas came to her funeral wearing armbands of black ashes. As they wiped their eyes, hugged each other, and covered the ears, they smudged the black ashes.</p>
