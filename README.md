# FEND_Animal_Trading_Cards_master

In this challenge we were given a design of an animal card with its features.
The purpose of the challenge was to translate the card into a real website and change that animal to the animal of our choice.

Things which was tested:
* The text is italicized for the animal’s interesting fact. 
* The labels are bolded for the animal’s list items. 
* The dots are removed from the animal’s list items. 
* Uses border around animal’s name, image, and information (interesting fact, list items, and description). 
* Uses border around animal’s information. 
* Uses spacing between animal’s name, image, and information. 
* The image’s alt is relevant to the animal used. 
* The HTML includes classes that are used for styling. 
* Classes are given meaningful names. 
* Student separates HTML from CSS by linking to stylesheet. 
* HTML code does not include elements or style attributes in the body. 
* Card width should be fixed and include the spacing around the image (Since image is 300px wide, card should be 300px + spacing on either side. Card should not expand with the browser window).  
* The image is 300px wide or the image’s width is set to 300px.
